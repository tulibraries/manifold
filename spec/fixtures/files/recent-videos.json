     "Join us for the second part of this conversation, continued from our Juneteenth celebrations, with Bob Perkins and WRTI music host and producer J. Michael Harrison. \n\nAbout the speakers: \nBob Perkins, also known as \"BP with the GM,\" (translation: \"Bob Perkins with the Good Music\"), has been in the broadcasting industry for more than five decades as an on-air host, and is now commonly referred to as a Philadelphia jazz radio legend.  \nBP broke into the radio business in 1964 when he landed an on-air job in Detroit. In 1969, his hometown of Philadelphia beckoned him back with a gig at rhythm-and-blues station WDAS, where he worked for the next 19 years. After a longtime gig at WHYY, he joined WRTI in 1997. (from WRTI) \nJ. Michael Harrison’s first radio show, WPEB’s “Is That Jazz” launched in June of 1993. In 1994 he began volunteering with WRTI as a production assistant. In 1996, J. Michael debuted his own program, The Bridge, which continues to air Friday evenings on WRTI. \nThe Bridge was selected as Philadelphia Magazine’s \"Best Radio Program” in 2002, and in 2007, the Philadelphia City Paper called it the “Best On-Air Reminder That Jazz Didn’t Die in 1965.” (from WRTI) \n\nThis program is presented in partnership with the Charles L. Blockson Collection of African-Americana and the African Diaspora at Penn State Special Collections Library.",
