Before her time at Temple, she served as assistant US attorney in Philadelphia and deputy city attorney in Los Angeles. Long a champion for women and minorities within the profession, she held roles in service to the legal profession, including leadership roles in the American Bar Association, the National Association of Women Lawyers and ALI-ABA.

Blockson Afro-American Collection. Cloud and Turner have collaborated to create this book that will help support the establishment of a permanent jazz archive at the Blockson Collection. \n\nAbout the book:\nMany scholars have traced improvised music in Philadelphia back through ragtime to the prominent Black orchestras that played quadrilles and marches for high-society dances in the 19th century, with one of the most famous led by Philadelphian Francis “Frank” Johnson. The Black migrations from the South to the North after World War I carried performers and their music to Chicago; New York City; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia. Musicians like Dizzy Gillespie and John Coltrane came from the Carolinas and started careers in Philadelphia, while homegrown talent from the city’s multiethnic neighborhoods—including violinist Joe Venuti, saxophonists Jimmy Heath and Charlie Ventura, organists Shirley Scott and Trudy Pitts, and pianist McCoy Tyner—made the world take notice of the musical gifts that contributed to the celebrated Philly sound. Philadelphia Jazz celebrates the immense contributions that the city’s jazz community has made to America’s true classical music. \n\nThis program is presented in partnership with the Charles L.

Each bears a dedication to a person who played a role in his life while he was living in this most musical of cities. He went to Vienna to study under Joseph Haydn, whose influence helped him gain a reputation as a virtuoso pianist and improviser performing for nobility in Vienna’s many musical salons. Once in Vienna, Beethoven began receiving instruction in the Italian vocal style from Antonio Salieri, the Austrian imperial Kapellmeister and former teacher of Mozart. And in 1802, he met Tsar Alexander I, who came to Vienna fresh from having swept through the Caucasus to conquer Georgia.
